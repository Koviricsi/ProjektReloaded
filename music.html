                        <p>
                            Once upon a younger year <br>
                            When all our shadows disappeared <br>
                            The animals inside came out to play <br>
                            Went face to face with all our fears <br>
                            Learned our lessons through the tears <br>
                            Made memories we knew would never fade <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One day, my father, he told me, "Son, don't let it slipaway" <br>
                            He took me in his arms, I heard him say <br>
                            "When you get older your wild heart will live for youngerdays <br>
                            Think of me if ever you're afraid" <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He said, "One day, you'll leave this world behind <br>
                            So live a life you will remember" <br>
                            My father told me when I was just a child <br>
                            "These are the nights that never die" <br>
                            My father told me <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "When thunderclouds start pouring down <br>
                            Light a fire they can't put out <br>
                            Carve your name into those shining stars" <br>
                            He said, "Go venture far beyond the shores <br>
                            Don't forsake this life of yours <br>
                            I'll guide you home no matter where you are" <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One day, my father, he told me, "Son, don't let it slip away" <br>
                            When I was just a kid, I heard him say <br>
                            "When you get older your wild heart will live for younger days <br>
                            Think of me if ever you're afraid" <br>

                            Feeling my way through the darkness <br>
                            Guided by a beating heart <br>
                            I can't tell where the journey will end <br>
                            But I know where to start <br>
                            They tell me I'm too young to understand <br>
                            They say I'm caught up in a dream <br>
                            Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes <br>
                            Well that's fine by me <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So wake me up when it's all over <br>
                            When I'm wiser and I'm older <br>
                            All this time I was finding myself, and I <br>
                            Didn't know I was lost <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So wake me up when it's all over <br>
                            When I'm wiser and I'm older <br>
                            All this time I was finding myself, and I <br>

                        <p>
                            I tried carrying the weight of the world <br>
                            But I only have two hands <br>
                            Hope I get the chance to travel the world <br>
                            But I don't have any plans <br>
                            Wish that I could stay forever this young <br>
                            Not afraid to close my eyes <br>
                            Life's a game made for everyone <br>
                            And love is a prize <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So wake me up when it's all over <br>

                            So wake me up when it's all over <br>
                            When I'm wiser and I'm older <br>
